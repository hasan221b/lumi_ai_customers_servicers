1- Sentiment Detection:
	What: Analyze user sentiment (happy, frustrated) and adjust responses (e.g., “Sorry you’re upset—here’s how I can 	help”).
	How: Use a lightweight sentiment model (e.g., transformers pipeline from Hugging Face) on user input before 	generating a response.
	Why: Adds emotional intelligence, making it more empathetic and user-friendly.
2- Proactive Recommendations
	What: Suggest related FAQs or actions based on the user’s query (e.g., “You asked about refunds—want to know about 	returns too?”).
	How: Use your RAG similarity search to find related entries and append them to the response.
	Why: Increases value by anticipating user needs, mimicking a proactive assistant.

3- Multi-Turn Conversations
	What: Enable the chatbot to maintain context across multiple messages, so users can ask follow-ups like “Can you 	explain that again?” or “What about pricing?”
	How: Use LangChain’s ConversationBufferMemory or ConversationChain to store and reference prior messages in a 	session. Store session data in memory (or a lightweight DB like SQLite for persistence).
	Why: Makes it feel less robotic and more like a real assistant, increasing user satisfaction.
4- Query Refinement
	What: If the chatbot doesn’t fully understand a question, it can ask clarifying questions (e.g., “Did you mean 	shipping costs or delivery times?”).
	How: Add a simple intent-detection layer (e.g., using a small NLP model like BERT via Hugging Face) or use 	LangChain’s prompting to generate clarification requests when confidence is low.
	Why: Reduces “I don’t know” responses, improving reliability.
5- Fallback Suggestions
	What: When the chatbot can’t answer, suggest related FAQs or external resources (e.g., “I don’t have that info, 	but here’s our guide on X”).
	How: Predefine fallback responses in your dataset or use a similarity search (via your RAG embeddings) to 	recommend the closest matching FAQ.
	Why: Keeps users engaged instead of hitting a dead end.
